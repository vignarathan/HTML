	<p>The Jaffna Public Library, a cornerstone of Tamil cultural heritage in Sri Lanka, was officially placed under the administration of the Jaffna Town Development Board on 1 January 1935.
	</p>
	<p>Before this, the library began as a modest initiative in August 1934, housed in a small rented room on Hospital Road, Jaffna, with a collection of 844 books and approximately 30 newspapers and magazines. As the collection expanded, necessitating more space, the library was relocated in January 1935 to a rented building on Main Street, Jaffna.
	</p>
	<p>Mr. Sam A. Sabapathy, who served as the first Mayor of Jaffna, demonstrated remarkable dedication in modernizing the Jaffna Public Library. Under his leadership, the library evolved from its humble origins into a thriving centre of learning, setting the stage for its emergence as one of South Asia’s most distinguished institutions. It connects his leadership to the broader transformation of the library—from modest beginnings to a prestigious cultural landmark.
